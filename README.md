This project will show the data analysis of the placentas of women who smoked during pregnancy through a webpage.
Smoking increases the risk of preterm delivery and complications such as placental preia and abruption. Results
provide insight into the molecular basis of smoke-induced placenta abnormalities.

Currently I have a working parser called parser_template1.py, I will change the file names once I have made my tables. I have transferred the geo data set into a file called samples.txt.
I am formatting the data set table, and once I have done this I will save it into a new file.
The file called data.md will have all the bits of code I have used and what the code does.

11/2/15 - I have started working through 'Introducing web pages'. 
12/2/15 - I went back to mysql to make tables, I have made tables for the data genes.txt, probes.txt and expression.txt
However I need to change the column names for the expression.txt table and I need to add in another column as I wasn't
sure what to name it. I have also tried to load the data into my tables, but a syntax error keeps coming up. My aim is to get this working by the end of the day.
