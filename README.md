This project will show the data analysis of the placentas of women who smoked during pregnancy through a webpage.
Smoking increases the risk of preterm delivery and complications such as placental preia and abruption. Results
provide insight into the molecular basis of smoke-induced placenta abnormalities.
Currently I have a working parser and I have transferred the data set into a file called samples.txt
I am formatting the data set table, and once I have done this I will save it into a new file.
The file called data.md will have all the bits of code I have used and what the code does.
